There have been projects in the past to try to bring templating to EJS. The two main projects are EJS Locals and EJS Express Layouts. These provide the ability to define different layouts like a sidebar layout and a full width layout and then call those on the fly. Sadly, EJS Locals is no longer maintained and EJS Express Layouts doesn't work with Express 4 at the time of this writing. Hopefully that will change in the future.
